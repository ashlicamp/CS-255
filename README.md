# CS-255
The client of this project is DriverPass, who wanted take advantage of a void in the market when it comes to training students for the driving test at their local DMV. The system they wanted designed would allow students to take practice tests online and in person.

I think the diagrams I created were something that I did particularly well, and if there was one part of my work on these documents that I would revise, it would be the bullets under the purpose and system background. I think I had a hard time differentiating between the two, so I would better my understanding of the requirements for those sections and improve it from there.

I thought the user's needs were quite easy to find within the provided client interview. It's important to ask the right questions to get information from them that they may not otherwise have thought to provide. The user's needs are the basis of the entire design - otherwise, a system will be created that is lacking major functionality for the client and it will have been a waste of money for them. Not all systems are "one-size-fits-all". 

I love the idea of using different UML diagrams to analyze and design a system. The diagrams are extremely useful in breaking down all components of the system and making it easy to understand for all team members. This is definitely an approach that I would take to designing systems in the future.
